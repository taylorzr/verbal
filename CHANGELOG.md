## [Unreleased]
### Added
- release documentation

## 2.3.0 - 2019-09-23
### Added
- you can now specify `validates :key { |value| ... }` on actions to run validation on the input
  *before* running the `call` block.

## 2.2.0 - 2017-08-19
### Added
- changelog started
- You can now specify default values for optional inputs in the `input` call.
  Use a regular value to load it once, at load-time, and a lambda to lazily load
  the value each time the action is called.
### Changed
- privatize Action.input. Now that we have Action.inputs, we want to avoid calling Action.input (no s) outside of the action itself

## 2.1.1 - 2017-02-21
### Fixed
- ensure Verbalize::Action.optional_input always returns an array

## 2.1.0 - 2017-02-21
### Added
- introspect Action input using Action.inputs, Action.required_inputs, and Action.optional_inputs

## 2.0.2 - 2017-2-21 [YANKED]

### Added
